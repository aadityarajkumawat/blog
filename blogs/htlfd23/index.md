# How to Learn Frontend Development (2023 Guide)

I'm often asked, "How do I learn web development?". So in this blog, I focus on guiding you through the whole process of learning.

And, before getting started, let me tell you if this is the beginning of a new journey for you, you are going to enter some really precious years of your life that are gonna shape your entire career and make you a f-ing tech lead.

So let’s start!

![Cool](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMzJiNjgzMDY3ZjE3ZjNlZDIzNzgyNDEwOTVlYjBkOTZlZTljNmU1MyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZzX2dpZklkJmN0PWc/xUOxf8R29PSTtF6PE4/giphy.gif)

What exactly is web development?

Simple, You write code to build a site/web app and maybe mobile apps at times that’s it, how to become one is the game.

How is a web application/ site built?

Let me break it down for you, there are essentially three moving components in a web app or a site, the frontend (the user interface you see or interact with), the server (a thing that supplies and process data), and lastly a database (a thing that stores data).

![Application Architecture](/blogs/htlfd23/arch.png)

So, broadly speaking there are two sides to building a web application. the frontend and the backend and you would often see companies hiring for Frontend Engineers, Backend Engineers, and Full-Stack Engineers (who are good at both frontend and backend), and people often tend to relate your role (frontend/backend) with the kind of person you are, if you are a frontend engineer you are probably good at design and stuff if you are a backend engineer you are more likely to be a math and numbers kinda guy, but working for around 4 years in this, I am sure it’s not like that most of the times because it doesn’t really depend on if you have an eye for good design or if you are great at math, the main thing to note here is whether you do frontend or backend none of them is easier than the other you just deal with a different aspect of the process.

Okay, so let me lay down a plan on how you can start right from scratch and what to do when you are done with it, you can also follow it if you are in the middle of learning. Mostly, I recommend people to start by picking up frontend and getting the hang of it, then branch out to learning stuff like building servers and managing databases for the backend only when they feel a need to have it because this helps you understand their real use.

Okay, but how do actually start working on this plan?

Alright time to get our hands dirty and talk some real tech guy things and honestly I feel getting yourself into it is the only way you are gonna make it as a 10x developer, so let’s start with an aim or a plan to build a full-stack application, you may not be able to make it right away but you are gonna learn some really important stuff on the way.

# Let’s start

Frontend is the user interface or the web page that you interact with in the browser to do stuff, this web page is called the user interface. But how do you even start building one, it’s easy a page is just the output of an HTML file, so whatever you put in the HTML file shows up on the browser, so this means we start by learning HTML, to understand how it works and what it does, for a brief understanding, HTML file, puts text content on your page, other things like colors and interactions are built using CSS and Javascript respectively, but just learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript is almost of no use these because almost no one really writes these directly, we use frameworks and libraries to deal with them, but everything boils down to these three at the core.

So, it’s really important to get the basics right here, I am gonna propose a very guided path to get these basics right, then we move to the framework that you learn to build modern web applications.

> You can use any text editor to write code, but I prefer using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because it is genuinely the best and also this is what most people use.

Also, I recommend spending good 2-3 months following the basic path and really building up yourself.

## Basics Path

<ol>
  <li>HTML and CSS
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">HTML by Brad Traversy</a> - Easy Peasy</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTHC78giGQ">CSS by FreeCodeCamp</a> - Fairly short tutorial as compared to other tutorials that are like 11 hours long, trust me if you get this one video right, that’s all you need, you don’t have to learn everything that exists in CSS, because firstly you don’t need them and also most people don’t care. You would find yourself using the same 10 CSS rules 90% of the time, so chill out.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8LTPIJBGwQ">Make a project</a> - This will conclude and help in wrapping your head around how HTML and CSS work together to make a site like what it does.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Javascript
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww">Start with the basics</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7rSSy8CaYE">Connecting HTML & CSS with Javascript</a></li>
      <li>Optional - For better and in-depth understanding (but don’t do them right away take time to process.)
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3XxeE7NF30">Project Based Learning (JS)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">Best Book for JS</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

While doing any of the above sections, no matter at what stage you are, I recommend taking this path very easily and slowly and do not try to learn everything at once give yourself space to process stuff, because the better you get at this, the better will be your learning experience in the following sections.

## Getting good at the game!

This is where javascript really starts getting fun, because from now on after you learn some framework that does stuff that you were doing using HTML, CSS, and Javascript is all handled by just one single framework.

You have a bunch of choices in what framework you want to write code, but each of them has its own pros and cons, generally software engineers know one framework really well and are about moderate at another one, but the point here is you only need to learn anyone, and you can learn the others if you want to try them out.

> I recommend you pick React and really master it.

<ol>
<li>
React - I will add a blog on particularly this very soon.
<ol>

<li>
<a href="https://react.dev/">Documentation</a>
</li>
   <li>
   <a href="https://youtu.be/QFaFIcGhPoM">Complete Series</a>
   </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

Svelte - Lightweight and Fast framework (alternative to ReactJS), generally used for simpler web apps.

   <ol>

   <li>

Solid - Signal-Based Blazingly Fast framework

   </li>
   </ol>
</li>
</ol>

There are more frameworks that do work similarly like Angular, Vue, etc. But these are the ones that I like and find the most intuitive to understand. You can learn stuff like Angular if you are interested in knowing “What is RxJS and how is reactivity achieved in an Isolated component?”.

This was a very broad guideline on how to get started, but I will keep pushing blogs for detailed learning guides on each of the frameworks recommended.

Thanks!
